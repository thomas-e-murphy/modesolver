# modesolver

A Python library for computing the electromagnetic eigenmodes of dielectric optical waveguides
using the finite difference method.  This library uses the method described in: 

A. B. Fallahkhair, K. S. Li and T. E. Murphy,
"Vector Finite Difference Modesolver for Anisotropic Dielectric Waveguides",
J. Lightwave Technol. 26(11), 1423-1431 (2008).

The library also includes examples, as well as a set of tools for defining refractive index 
profiles, and post-processing the modes.
